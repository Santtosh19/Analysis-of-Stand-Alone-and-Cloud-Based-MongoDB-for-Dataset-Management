# Analysis-of-Stand-Alone-and-Cloud-Based-MongoDB-for-Dataset-Management
This project involves an in-depth analysis and comparison of stand-alone and cloud-based MongoDB platforms for managing large-scale datasets, specifically in the context of healthcare. The study focuses on the performance, scalability, and suitability of each platform for handling complex queries on healthcare data, with the ultimate goal of determining the most efficient database management system for healthcare applications.


Key Objectives:

1.Performance Analysis: Evaluate the performance of stand-alone MongoDB and MongoDB Atlas (cloud-based) when handling large healthcare datasets.

2.Suitability for Healthcare: Assess which platform is more suitable for healthcare data management, particularly in environments with varying data sizes and processing needs.


***Dataset:

Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS): A large dataset provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), containing extensive health-related data collected via telephone interviews from over half a million U.S. residents annually. Obtained from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cdc/behavioral-risk-factor-surveillance-system

***Platform Setup:

1. Stand-Alone MongoDB: Installed on local machines, providing complete control over data and potentially faster query execution due to the absence of network latency.
   
2. MongoDB Atlas: A cloud-based platform set up to leverage scalability, ease of setup, and managed services for healthcare data management.
   
Query Implementation:

Developed and executed meaningful queries on both platforms to compare their performance in real-world healthcare data management scenarios.
